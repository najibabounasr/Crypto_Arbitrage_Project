# Crypto Arbitrage Project

## 
> This is a crypto arbitrage application that can be used to track the price of BTC being sold on two exchanges: bitstamp and coinbase. Using the program, you will be able to see a number of different data plots and descriptions to visually and numerically understand when arbitrage gains are at their possible heighest, or lowest. The program will compare the prices, time of price, and price movements to 'find' when price disparities are most pronounced, and provides potential arbitrage traders with a calculation of their possible profit per trade, or within a specified timeframe at the end.
